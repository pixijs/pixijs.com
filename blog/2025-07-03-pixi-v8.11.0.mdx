PixiJS v8.11.0 introduces powerful new text tools for creating advanced animations and several quality-of-life improvements. Here's what's new:

- **SplitText & SplitBitmapText:** Split text into lines, words, and characters for fine-grained control and advanced animations
- **New `origin` Property for Containers:** Rotate and scale around a defined point without affecting position
- **`replaceChild` Method:** Seamlessly swap display objects while preserving transforms
- **BitmapText Word Breaking:** `breakWords` now works with `BitmapText` for better layout control
- **llms.txt Support:** We've added official support for the `llms.txt` standard to help AI tools discover and respect PixiJS v8 content.
- **PixiJS Showcase:** Submit your project and get featured on our new community gallery
- **Sponsorship Updates:** We're now live on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pixijs) with new and improved sponsorship tiers

Let's dive into the details.

## **SplitText & SplitBitmapText**

:::warning
This feature is experimental and may change in future releases.
If you encounter any issues, please report them on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues).
:::

We all love animated text, but until now, breaking text into individual characters, words, or lines was a pain. With the new `SplitText` and `SplitBitmapText` classes, you can control text at any level with ease.

You can:

- Animate each segment independently using tweening libraries like GSAP.
- Define independent "anchor" points for characters, words, and lines.
- Dynamically update text or style at runtime.
- Split existing `Text` or `BitmapText`.

```ts
import { SplitText } from 'pixi.js';

// Create new SplitText instance
const newSplitText = new SplitText({ text: 'Hello Pixi', style: { fontSize: 36 } });

// Split existing Text object
const myText = new Text('Hello Pixi', { fontSize: 36 });
const splitText = SplitText.from(myText);
```

<EmbeddedEditor
  files={{
    'index.js': BitmapOverlapIndexFile,
  }}
  dependencies={{ gsap: 'latest', 'pixi.js': 'latest' }}
/>

<br/>
See full examples and usage guide [here](/8.x/guides/components/scene-objects/text/split-text).

:::warning
Heads-up: When splitting characters, browser kerning is lost, so spacing may differ slightly compared to standard text. This trade-off gives you creative flexibility, but it's something to be aware of for pixel-perfect layouts.

## **New `container.origin` Property**

The new `origin` property allows you to control where a container rotates or scales from, without shifting its position in the scene.

```ts
new Container({ origin: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
new Container({ origin: 50 }); // Same as { x: 50, y: 50 }
```

<EmbeddedEditor
  files={{
    'index.js': OriginIndexFile,
  }}
/>

**Why not use `pivot`?**

While `pivot` changes the transform origin, it also modifies the containerâ€™s position, making layout and animation logic more complex.

The `origin` property provides a predictable, position-stable alternative for transform control.

---

## **New `container.replaceChild` Method**

This new method allows you to swap out one display object for another within a container and the new child inherits the local transform of the old one. This means you can replace objects without losing their index, position, scale, rotation, or any other local transforms.

```ts
container.replaceChild(oldChild, newChild);
```

This is perfect for use cases like swapping static text with a `SplitText` version for dynamic effects.

```ts
const myText = new BitmapText({
  text: 'Hello Pixi',
  style: {...},
  scale: 2,
  skew: { x: 0.1, y: 0.2 },
  anchor: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 },
});
const segmented = SplitBitmapText.from(myText);

// Use the new replaceChild method to swap text
container.replaceChild(myText, segmented);
```

---

## **Better Word Breaking for BitmapText**

The `breakWords` option now works with `BitmapText`. This improves layout control for projects using bitmap fonts, making it easier to manage dynamic text, labels, and UI elements.

<EmbeddedEditor
  files={{
    'index.js': BitmapBreakIndexFile,
  }}
/>

## `llms.txt` Support

We now officially support the `llms.txt` convention to help AI tools access accurate PixiJS documentation.
We provide several documentation files for different context window sizes:

| File                                                     | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`/llms.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms.txt)               | Index of available documentation files                                            |
| [`/llms-full.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms-full.txt)     | Complete API documentation including all classes, methods, and examples           |
| [`/llms-medium.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms-medium.txt) | Compressed documentation optimized for AI tools with medium-sized context windows |

These files are generated automatically from our TypeScript definitions and documentation sources. They update daily to ensure LLMs and AI-powered tools can reference the most accurate, up-to-date PixiJS information.

This helps coding assistants, search tools, and documentation bots provide correct suggestions and avoids outdated or incorrect information being used.

## **PixiJS Showcase is Live**

We love seeing what you build with PixiJS. The new [PixiJS Showcase](https://pixijs.com/showcase) highlights games, websites, apps, tools, and experiments created by the community.

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    paddingBottom: '24px',
    maxWidth: 700,
    margin: '0 auto',
  }}
>
  <img
    src={'/images/blog/showcase.webp'}
    alt="Tags Example"
    style={{
      borderRadius: '12px',
      boxShadow: '0 0 20px hsla(340, 82%, 52%, 0.15)',
    }}
  />
</div>

If you've made something cool, we'd love to show it off. Just fill out the submission form on the page. We're always amazed by the creativity of the Pixi community!

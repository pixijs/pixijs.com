Today we are releasing **[PixiJS Layout]((https://pixijs.io/layout)) v3**, a complete rebuild of the library from the ground up. This new version brings a more powerful, flexible, and intuitive way to manage layout inside PixiJS projects, all powered by the [Yoga](https://www.yogalayout.dev/) layout engine.

This release introduces many breaking changes, but they deliver major improvements in developer experience, performance, and flexibility.

## A Complete Rebuild

v3 is a **ground-up rewrite**, built on the proven [**Yoga**](https://www.yogalayout.dev/) layout engine. This shift enables predictable, web-standard layout behavior and allows developers to opt-in only where they need it.

This release focuses on two major goals:

-   **Optional layout**: Use layout exactly where you need it, without restructuring your entire project.
-   **Reliable behavior**: Built on [Yoga](https://www.yogalayout.dev/), bringing standardized flexbox-like layout to 2D graphics.

The transition to v3 requires some adjustments, but it establishes a stronger, more flexible foundation for building interfaces in PixiJS.

## What‚Äôs New

### Yoga-Powered Layout

[Yoga](https://www.yogalayout.dev/) drives all layout calculations, offering robust flexbox support with familiar concepts like `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, and responsive sizing.

### Opt-In by Design

Layout is completely optional. You can apply it selectively to specific containers, sprites, graphics, or text objects.

### Any PixiJS Object, Layout-Aware

With [PixiJS Layout]((https://pixijs.io/layout)) v3, **any** PixiJS display object can be made layout-aware ‚Äî Containers, Sprites, Text, Graphics, TilingSprites, even custom objects. You do not need special wrapper components or complex setup.

You can enable layout simply by setting a `layout` property:

```typescript
const sprite = new Sprite({ texture, layout: true });
```

Or define layout inline when creating objects:

```typescript
const container = new Container({
    layout: {
        width: 500,
        height: 300,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignContent: 'center',
        flexWrap: 'wrap',
    },
});
```

### Web-Style Features

We have added several web-style features to enhance layout capabilities:

-   **`objectFit`**: Control how content scales inside containers (`fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, `scale-down`).
-   **`objectPosition`**: Fine-tune content alignment within layout regions.
-   **Overflow scrolling**: Enable `overflow: scroll` for any container.
-   **PixiJS Rect integration**: Layout now works seamlessly with `Rect` objects for easy sizing.

### Documentation Overhaul

We have **completely rewritten the [documentation](https://pixijs.io/layout)** to match the new system. It now includes:

-   Clear guides for getting started and best practices
-   Detailed examples covering common use cases
-   Improved explanations of layout behavior and PixiJS integration

The new [documentation](https://pixijs.io/layout) makes it easier than ever to get up and running.

## Getting Started

Getting started with PixiJS Layout v3 is simple and due to the opt-in nature of the library, you can use it in any PixiJS project without needing to refactor your entire codebase.

Check out the [**Getting Started**](https://pixijs.io/layout/docs/guides/guide/quick-start) guide for a step-by-step introduction but here‚Äôs a quick overview:

### Setup

Install PixiJS Layout v3:

```bash
pnpm add @pixi/layout
# or
yarn add @pixi/layout
# or
npm install @pixi/layout
```

Import the library early in your application:

```typescript
import '@pixi/layout';

// ... initialize your app
```

Apply layout when and where you need it:

```typescript
const container = new Container({
    layout: {
        width: 500,
        height: 300,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignContent: 'center',
        flexWrap: 'wrap',
    },
});

const sprite = new Sprite({ texture, layout: true });

container.addChild(sprite);
```

## Conclusion

We encourage you to explore the new features, read the [documentation](https://pixijs.io/layout), and share your feedback with us. We are excited to see how you will use the new layout system in your projects!

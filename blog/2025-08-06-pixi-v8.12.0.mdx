PixiJS v8.12.0 is out, and it brings with it the results of our first-ever Bug Hunt Month.

Throughout July, we put our focus entirely on bugs, fixing them, triaging them, closing stale ones, and adding bounties for critical ones. The result? One of our most productive maintenance months to date:

- 45 bugs fixed
- 250+ issues closed
- Dozens of triaged and clarified issues
- Several bounties assigned and paid out

A big thank-you to everyone who helped report, debug, test, or fix problems during the month. We had several new contributors jump in and make meaningful improvements to the engine.

Let's take a look at what's changed in this release.

## A Few Helpful Additions

While this was mostly a bug-fix release, we did sneak in a few useful additions:

- You can now control the `scaleMode` when using `cacheAsTexture`
  ```ts
  container.cacheAsTexture({
    scaleMode: 'nearest',
  });
  ```
- We've exposed a `maxAnisotropy` property on `TextureSource` to align with other `TextureStyle` properties being passed through.
  ```ts
  texture.source.maxAnisotropy = 16;
  ```
- New `DomAdapter.createImage()` function for creating image elements. This allows environments such as Node to create things like SVG's.
  ```ts
  const image = DomAdapter.get().createImage();
  image.src = 'path/to/image.svg';
  ```
- You can now share a WebGPU adapter/device between PixiJS and other rendering engines
  ```ts
  const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
  const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

  const app = new Application();
  await app.init({ gpu: { adapter, device } });
  ```
- Asset `loadParser` has been deprecated and replaced with `parser` and the names of the parsers have been deprecated and simplified
  ```ts
  // Old way
  await Assets.load({ src: 'path/to/asset', data: { loadParser: 'loadJson' } });
  // New way
  await Assets.load({ src: 'path/to/asset', data: { parser: 'json' } });

  // Name changes
  // 'loadJson' -> 'json'
  // 'loadSvg' -> 'svg'
  // 'loadTxt' -> 'text'
  // 'loadVideo' -> 'video'
  // 'loadWebFont' -> 'web-font'
  // 'loadBitmapFont' -> 'bitmap-font'
  // 'spritesheetLoader' -> 'spritesheet'
  // 'loadTextures' -> 'texture'
  // 'loadBasis' -> 'basis'
  // 'loadDds' -> 'dds'
  // 'loadKtx2' -> 'ktx2'
  // 'loadKtx' -> 'ktx'
  ```
- A new `WorkerManager.reset()` method helps release memory and reset the worker pool, which is useful for long-running applications that need to clear out old workers.
  ```ts
  app.destroy(true, true); // Destroy the app
  WorkerManager.reset(); // Reset the worker pool
  ```

## Over 35 Bug Fixes

This release includes targeted fixes across a wide range of areas:

- Masks now render correctly when outside the viewport
- `AnimatedSprite.destroy()` now behaves correctly
- HTMLText tags and styles are handled more reliably
- Pattern and gradient fills render as expected for installed `BitmapText`
- `BitmapFont` gets multiple layout and rendering fixes
- Several issues with masking, transform origin, and culling were resolved
- Accessibility and scaling quirks are addressed

You can view the full changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases/v8.12.0) if you're interested in the details.

## Internal Tools and Dev Experience

Beyond the fixes and features, we also made a number of internal improvements:

- Added StackBlitz integration to make sharing and testing easier. You can check it out here: [StackBlitz Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/pixijs-v8?file=src%2Fmain.js)
- Improved our GitHub issue templates and automation around reproduction steps. We are now requiring a reproduction for new issues to help us address them more effectively. If no reproduction is provided, the issue will be closed automatically after 7 days.
- Updated Node compatibility to support Node 24 when building the project.

These changes aren't user-facing, but they should make contributing and debugging a smoother experience.

## Bug Bounty Program

As part of Bug Hunt Month, we officially launched our [bug bounty program](https://pixijs.com/8.x/bug-bounty). If you're a contributor, this means some issues may come with a small reward for fixing them, especially bugs that are tough to reproduce or critical to users.

If you're looking to contribute to PixiJS, this is a great way to get started. You can find all current bounty-tagged issues [here](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%F0%9F%92%B0Bounty).

### Why We're Doing This

We believe in the power of open source and community collaboration. Our bug bounty program is designed to:

- Encourage contributors to tackle important, impactful issues.
- Recognize the hard work involved in debugging and fixing complex problems.
- Acknowledge that the PixiJS core team is small and often focused on other critical tasks, your contributions help get issues resolved faster.
- Make PixiJS even better for everyone.

### Sponsoring Bounties

If you are a developer or company working on a project and would like to sponsor a one-off bounty, please contact **Matt Karl** [@bigtimebuddy](https://github.com/bigtimebuddy) at [hello@mattkarl.com](mailto:hello@mattkarl.com) to arrange the details.

Sponsors can make one-time donations directly to our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pixijs) to fund the bounty.

## PixiJS Layout v3.1.0

Alongside the main engine update, we also shipped a new version of **PixiJS Layout**.

This update includes a few key quality-of-life improvements:

- You can now define a custom default Yoga config
  ```ts
  const config = getYoga().Config.create();

  config.setExperimentalFeatureEnabled(ExperimentalFeature.WebFlexBasis, true);
  setYogaConfig(config);
  ```
- New options make drag easing more controllable
  ```ts
  const container = new LayoutContainer({
      layout: {
          overflow: 'scroll',
      },
      trackpad: {
          // Constrain scrolling within bounds
          constrain: true,
          // Percentage of overflow allowed when dragging beyond x-axis limit
          xConstrainPercent: 0.2,
          // Percentage of overflow allowed when dragging beyond y-axis limit
          yConstrainPercent: 0.2
      },
  });
  ```

We also fixed several bugs related to layout updates, reparenting, visibility, and container sizing. These fixes make layout behavior more predictable and align better with how developers expect Flexbox-style layouts to behave.

We've also improved StackBlitz integration and our bug reporting flow here as well.

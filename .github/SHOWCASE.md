# Contributing to the PixiJS Showcase

We love seeing what the community creates with PixiJS! If youâ€™ve built something cool and want to share it with the world, you can add your project to our showcase by following the steps below.

## Image Requirements

To keep the showcase looking clean and consistent, please follow these image guidelines:

* **Dimensions**: \~460Ã—260 pixels (landscape orientation)
* **Formats accepted**: `.avif`, `.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
* **Max file size**: 200 KB
* **Quality**: High-resolution, crisp screenshot that best represents your project

Add your image to the [`static/showcase/`](/static/showcase/) directory in the repository.

## Project Information Format

Your project entry must follow this TypeScript interface:

```ts
interface ShowcaseItem {
  title: string; // Project name
  author: string; // Your name or organization
  imageUrl: string; // Path to the showcase image
  link: string; // URL to live project/demo
  alt?: string; // Alt text for screen readers
  isSponsored?: boolean; // Mark only if you're an official sponsor
  isOpenSource?: boolean; // Is your code open source?
}
```

Example entry:

```ts
{
  title: 'Your Amazing Project',
  author: 'Your Name',
  imageUrl: '/showcase/your-image.png',
  link: 'https://your-project.com',
  isOpenSource: true,
}
```

Add this object to the `showcaseItems` array in [`src/pages/showcase/content.ts`](/src/pages/showcase/content.ts).

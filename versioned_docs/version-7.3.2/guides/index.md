# Welcome

PixiJS is an open source, web-based rendering system that provides blazing fast performance for games, data visualization, and other graphics intensive projects. These guides are designed to be a companion to the [API documentation](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html), providing a structured introduction to using the API to solve problems and build projects.

## About The Guides

If you're new to PixiJS, we suggest you start with the Basics and read through them in order (a good place to start is [Getting Started](guides/basics/getting-started)).  While PixiJS has a mature API and solid documentation, the guides go over many common issues and questions that developers new to the system encounter.

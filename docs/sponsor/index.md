## Sponsoring PixiJS as a Business

Supporting PixiJS isn’t just good for open source—it’s good business. Whether you're building games, creative tools, or data visualizations, sponsoring PixiJS gives you:

- **Visibility and brand recognition** across our website, documentation, showcase, and release posts.
- **Direct investment in the tools you rely on**, helping ensure continued updates and a healthy, well-maintained codebase.
- **Help shape the roadmap** by supporting the features and improvements that matter most to your product.

Sponsorship is also an excellent way to attract developer talent. By contributing to a community-driven project, your brand demonstrates a commitment to quality engineering and open collaboration.

If your product or service depends on PixiJS, sponsoring helps ensure its long-term stability—and gives you a voice in prioritizing features and fixes.

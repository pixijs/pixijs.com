## Getting Started with the Ecosystem

To explore these libraries, visit their respective documentation and GitHub repositories for installation instructions and usage guides. Additionally, PixiJS offers [**Creation Templates**](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/docs/guide/creations/intro/) through the [PixiJS Create CLI](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/) that combine many of these libraries into pre-configured setups, ideal for specific use cases and platforms.

For inspiration, you can also check out the [open-games repository](https://github.com/pixijs/open-games), which showcases a variety of games built with PixiJS and its ecosystem libraries.

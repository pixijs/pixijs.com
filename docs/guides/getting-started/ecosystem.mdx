PixiJS itself is just a rendering engine. However, there is a foundation of a robust ecosystem of libraries and tools that enhance and expand its capabilities. These tools integrate seamlessly with PixiJS, empowering developers to create richer, more interactive applications with ease.

## Core Ecosystem Libraries

### [DevTools](https://pixijs.io/devtools/)
Optimize and debug your PixiJS projects with DevTools. This browser extension offers real-time insights into application performance, rendering hierarchies, and texture management, ensuring your projects run smoothly.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    style={{
        borderRadius: '10px', filter: 'drop-shadow(0px 2px 5px #000)', maxWidth: 600, width: '100%'
    }}
    alt="Screenshot from terminal"
    src="/assets/guides/devtool-screenshot.png"
  />
</div>

### [React Integration](https:/react.pixijs.io/)

## [PixiJS Userland](https://github.com/pixijs-userland) - Community-Driven Repositories

PixiJS Userland is a dedicated space for hosting community-driven repositories. This organization allows developers to collaborate on PixiJS-related projects and share their work with the wider community.

If you have an idea for a new library or tool, you can request access to PixiJS Userland to create and maintain a repository within the organization. This is a great opportunity to contribute to the growing PixiJS ecosystem and engage with like-minded developers.

Note that userland repositories are community-driven and may not be up to date with the latest PixiJS releases. However, they offer a wealth of resources and inspiration for developers looking to enhance their PixiJS projects.

## Getting Started with the Ecosystem

To explore these libraries, visit their respective documentation and GitHub repositories for installation instructions and usage guides. Additionally, PixiJS offers [**Creation Templates**](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/docs/guide/creations/intro/) through the [PixiJS Create CLI](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/) that combine many of these libraries into pre-configured setups, ideal for specific use cases and platforms.

For inspiration, you can also check out the [open-games repository](https://github.com/pixijs/open-games), which showcases a variety of games built with PixiJS and its ecosystem libraries.

## Creating a New Project

:::info[Prerequisites]

- Familiarity with the command line and a basic understanding of JavaScript.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v20.0 or higher.
  :::

In this section, we will introduce how to scaffold a PixiJS application on your local machine. The created project will use a pre-configured build setup, allowing you to quickly get started with PixiJS development.

Make sure your current working directory is where you want to create your project. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm create pixi.js@latest
```

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingBottom: '24px' }}>
  <img
    width="500"
    style={{ borderRadius: '10px', filter: 'drop-shadow(0px 2px 5px #000)' }}
    alt="Screenshot from terminal"
    src="https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/img/demo.gif"
  />
</div>

This command will install and execute the [PixiJS Create](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/) CLI and begin scaffolding your project. You will be prompted to configure your project by selecting various options, including selecting a template type for setting up your project. There are two main types of templates to choose from:

<div style={{ paddingLeft: '48px'}}>
#### Creation Templates (Recommended)
Creation templates are tailored for specific platforms and include additional configurations and dependencies to streamline development for a particular use case. These templates are more opinionated and are perfect for beginners or those looking for a ready-to-go setup.

#### Bundler Templates

Bundler templates are general templates designed to scaffold a PixiJS project with a specific bundler. They include the necessary configurations and dependencies but leave the project structure flexible, making them ideal for experienced developers who prefer more control.

We recommended using the Vite + PixiJS template for most projects when using bundler templates, as it provides a modern and fast setup for PixiJS applications with minimal configuration.

</div>

After selecting your desired template, the scaffolding tool will create a new project directory with the chosen configuration. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also add PixiJS to an existing project:

```bash
npm install pixi.js
```

## Usage

Once you've set up your project, here's a simple example to get started with PixiJS:

{/* embedded:@site/docs/examples/container_transform_pivot_basic.js */}
<EmbeddedEditor fontSize={14} width={"100%"} viewType={"editor"} height={700} files={{"index.js": IndexFile}} />

<br />

:::warning
If using Vite you still need to wrap your code in an async function. There is an issue when using top level await with PixiJS when building for production.

This issue is known to affect Vite \<=6.0.6. Future versions of Vite may resolve this issue.

# Documentation for LLMs

PixiJS supports the [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) convention for making documentation accessible to large language models (LLMs) and the applications that utilize them.

## Available Files

We provide several documentation files at different compression levels to accommodate various context window sizes:

- [`/llms.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms.txt) - An index of available documentation files
- [`/llms-full.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms-full.txt) - Complete PixiJS API documentation including all classes, methods, and examples
- [`/llms-medium.txt`](https://pixijs.com/llms-medium.txt) - Compressed documentation optimized for medium context windows

These files are automatically generated and updated daily from our TypeScript definition files and documentation sources.

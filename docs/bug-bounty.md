# Bug Bounty Program

PixiJS is committed to delivering a reliable, high-performance rendering engine for the web. To support that mission, weâ€™re launching a **Bug Bounty Program** to reward contributors who help make PixiJS more stable and robust.

## How It Works

1. **Bounty Tag Assignment**
   The PixiJS team will identify eligible issues and apply the **`bounty`** label along with a specific **dollar amount**.
   Example: `bounty: $100`

   Only issues labeled with the `bounty` tag and a dollar amount are eligible for this program.

2. **Submission Requirements**
   To claim a bounty, you must:

   - Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** that fixes the issue.
   - Link the issue in your PR description.
   - Include a clear **example or test case** demonstrating that the bug is resolved.
   - Follow our standard contribution guidelines.

3. **Approval Process**

   - The PixiJS team will review your PR.
   - If your fix is accepted and merged into the main branch, your bounty is approved.

4. **Requesting Payment**
   Once your PR is merged:

   - You can submit a payout request via our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pixijs) page.
   - Include a link to the merged PR and the bounty issue in your request.
   - Payments will be processed through Open Collective.

## Terms & Conditions

- Only issues **pre-approved** with a `bounty` tag and dollar amount are eligible.
- Bounties are awarded **at the PixiJS team's discretion**. We reserve the right to reject fixes that are incomplete, introduce regressions, or do not meet project standards.
- You may submit fixes for issues without a bounty tag, but they will not be eligible for financial rewards.
- Multiple contributors can submit PRs for the same bounty, but only the PR that gets merged is eligible for payment.
- The bounty amount is fixed and non-negotiable.
- Abuse, spamming, or low-quality submissions may result in exclusion from the program.

## **Finding Bounty Issues**

You can easily find eligible bounty issues by filtering them on our GitHub repository:

- Go to the [PixiJS Issues](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues) page.
- Click the **Labels** dropdown menu at the top of the issues list (as shown below).
- Select the `bounty` label to view only bounty-tagged issues.

This allows you to focus your contributions on tasks that have a financial reward.

## Why We're Doing This

We believe in the power of open source and community collaboration. Our bug bounty program is designed to:

- Encourage contributors to tackle important, impactful issues.
- Recognize the hard work involved in debugging and fixing complex problems.
- Make PixiJS even better for everyone.

# You did it!

Congratulations, hope you enjoyed the journey! Now you are an expert on the Graphics API. Make sure to explore other features that the API has to offer on the official [documentation](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Graphics.html), like the ability to cut shapes out from existing ones, advance lines and curves, using gradients or textures for fill and stroke - just to list a few.

Feel free to head back to the gallery and explore other tutorials.

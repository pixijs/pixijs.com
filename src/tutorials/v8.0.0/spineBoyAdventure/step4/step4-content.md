# Animating Character

Returning to the star of our workshop, let's upgrade our Character to handle various movement animations. For this example, we will simply store a state set where we can then use an update loop to trigger animations according to the combination of the state values. We can then externally update the character state depending on the controller input state.

## Preparation

For the upgrade, an animation map and assorted helper methods have been added to make handling Spine animation a little cleaner.

### Animation Map

This lists out all the available animations to be included in our character, each with a `name` parameter that corresponds to an animation key existed on the character Spine data and an optional `loop` and `timeScale` parameters to customize the animation.

```javascript
const animationMap = {
    idle: {
        name: 'idle',
        loop: true,
    },
    walk: {
        name: 'walk',
        loop: true,
    },
    run: {
        name: 'run',
        loop: true,
    },
    jump: {
        name: 'jump',
        timeScale: 1.5,
    },
    hover: {
        name: 'hoverboard',
        loop: true,
    },
    spawn: {
        name: 'portal',
    },
};
```
### Helper Methods

#### `playAnimation(animation)`

Wraps Spine state's `setAnimation(track, name, loop)` method that plays an animation using a passed in animation data defined on the animation map. It prevents the same animation from being played on top of each other.

<hr />

#### `isAnimationPlaying(animation)`

Check whether an animation is still active. That is when the Spine state's main track has a track entry of an animation with a key equals to that of the queried animation's name, and that the track entry is yet completed.

<hr />

#### `spawn()`

Simply kick start the portal-in spawn animation. To be triggered externally.

<hr />

#### `isSpawning()`

Utilizing the `isAnimationPlaying(animation)` to check if the spawn animation is still ongoing.

<hr />

### Handling Direction

You may have noticed that the spine instance is now wrapped in an extra `directionalView` container before being added to the main view. This is just to distinctly separate the transform, especially the horizontal scaling in this case where we will externally set to be `1` for rightward or `-1` for leftward depending on the controller input state. A getter and setter for `direction` have been added for simplification.

### Spine State Animation Default Mix

`this.spine.state.data.defaultMix = 0.2` sets the default amount of time in second for the state to blend the animations when transitioning from one to another for all animations, like a cross-fade of the skeletal positions.

## Update Loop

The only thing left to do is to handle the animation according to the character state in real-time on the `update()` method. Let's utilize all the stuff that has been prepared for us. In a logical order of priority for this specific example:

- `jump` state should be handle immediately and the character should remain in the jump animation until it finishes even the jump state is no longer `true`.

- The rest of the state members should trigger a corresponding animation immediately, depending on the priority order: `hover` > `run` > `walk` > `idle`. Note that multiple state members can be `true` at the same time, ie. `walk` will be `true` while `run` is `true` since the directional key is down in both scenarios.

```javascript
if (this.state.jump) this.playAnimation(animationMap.jump);
if (this.isAnimationPlaying(animationMap.jump)) return;
if (this.state.hover) this.playAnimation(animationMap.hover);
else if (this.state.run) this.playAnimation(animationMap.run);
else if (this.state.walk) this.playAnimation(animationMap.walk);
else this.playAnimation(animationMap.idle);
```

## Connecting to Controller

Back on `index.js`, let's trigger the character's spawn animation at the start and update our application's ticker update callback.

On the callback, we should skip updating the character state and calling its local update loop while the spawn animation is happening. Otherwise, we can hook the controller input state to the character state as followed:

- `left` and `right` input `pressed` state will toggle on character's `walk` state and will update its direction value which should flip the character back and fourth horizontally to face the correct way. `doubleTap` state will also toggle on character's `run` state while still updating the direction accordingly.
- `down` input state is dedicated to character's `hover` state.
- `space` input state is dedicated to character's `jump` state.

```javascript
spineBoy.spawn();

app.ticker.add(() =>
{
    if (spineBoy.isSpawning()) return;

    spineBoy.state.walk = controller.keys.left.pressed || controller.keys.right.pressed;
    if (spineBoy.state.run && spineBoy.state.walk) spineBoy.state.run = true;
    else spineBoy.state.run = controller.keys.left.doubleTap || controller.keys.right.doubleTap;
    spineBoy.state.hover = controller.keys.down.pressed;
    if (controller.keys.left.pressed) spineBoy.direction = -1;
    else if (controller.keys.right.pressed) spineBoy.direction = 1;
    spineBoy.state.jump = controller.keys.space.pressed;

    spineBoy.update();
});
```

That's a wrap for our character! Now we need an environment for him to be moving in.
